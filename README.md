An end-to-end AI-powered job recommendation system that analyzes a user’s resume to generate profile insights and fetch real-time job opportunities.

Built with a modular architecture supporting a Streamlit UI for interactive exploration and an MCP-based server to expose job search capabilities as reusable tools for agent and client integrations.
